  `Strategic spatial planning is the conceptualisation of realistic
  and desirable futures and charting out the plan to reach it.
  The vision must result in a multi-faceted goal of what the region must achieve
  and encompass of at the end of the set time period.`,

  `The term sustainable development as “development that meets the needs
  of the present without compromising the ability of future generations
  to meet their own needs” (U.N. World Commission on Environment and Development 1987)
  In terms of planning for sustainable the three pillars of sustainable development
  can be defined as Society, Economy and Environment.`,

  `The view of agriculture as a purely rural activity has changed.
  It has the ability to promote regional development, improve environmental quality
  and quality of life. It increases economic gains by offering employment and livelihood options
  and reducing food prices and cushions the effects of inflation as the region
  is less dependent on external prices and combats health issues that
  results from unhealthy eating (RUAF 2014).
  `,

  `Recognising the layered and complex nature of human settlements,
  the concept of planning now considers the various aspects that coalesce to create holistic living.
  It understands that built form, micro-climates, water management, livelihoods, wildlife corridors,
  soil quality, etc. have to be seriously mapped and integrated into the growth strategy
  of the region. Furthermore, intangible aspects such as culture, aspirations, resilience,
  traditional wisdom etc. are critical components that need to be weaved into the development
  strategy.
