      At some point, you might need to translate and display your website in
      multiple languages. Whether you’re handling a WordPress blog or a media
      website, a hotel or a corporate website or even if you’re managing a
      WooCommerce shop. In this article we’ll first describe who you should
      translate your website for and why, then we’ll focus on key elements
      required for any multilingual website and we’ll finally explain how you
      can easily do that using Weglot Translate plugin. Who should you translate
      your website for and why? Before getting started, let’s take a look at who
      you should be translating your website for and why it’s so important that
      you do. The WHO Whether you’re willing to reach a broader audience or to
      be present internationally, first you need to identify your current
      visitors and to select languages to target. You already know your
      audience, good! You don’t, then use Google analytics to map who your
      visitors are and where they are coming from. Based on this analysis draw a
      list of targeted languages covering your current and future visitors’
      languages. The WHY Grow your activity! Making your WordPress website
      multilingual unlocks 3 key growth drivers for your activity: Enlarge your
      addressable audience/market Increase your website traffic, supported by
      relevant acquisition strategy Improve your conversion ratio via an
      enhanced user experience Bottom-line, it’s all about increasing your
      revenues or subscribers at the different level of your acquisition funnel.
      What are the key elements when going multilingual? There are 2 very
      important aspects to look after when you’re making your website
      multilingual: (1) SEO and (2) User experience. Multilingual SEO There is
      one thing you want to be sure of: being indexed in your translated
      languages. Especially when you’re an e-commerce or online service web app.
      Based on Google SEO guidelines you should ensure that: Translated pages
      have dedicated and unique URL, using sub-directories (mywebsite.com/es,
      mywebsite.com/fr) or sub-domains (es.mywebsite.com, fr.mywebsite.com) for
      examples. Do not use query strings like ?lang=es or ?lang=fr Source code
      content is translated, otherwise your translations will never be visible
      for Google, hence not indexed. Do not use JavaScript solutions that only
      dynamically translate content without changing the source code Google can
      easily know your website is multilingual, by adding hreflang tags or
      having a sitemap User Experience Translated pages should help you to get
      more visitors and improved your conversion ratio. This is only possible if
      you pay attention to user experience in your translated versions:
      Automatic detection of visitors’ language, based on their browser’s
      preference Selected language should remain while visiting different pages,
      links have to be adjusted to be sure you’re not going back to the default
      language Monitoring translations quality for your different pages, having
      professional human translations for most visited pages, and automatic
      translations for less important ones for example Weglot Translation plugin
      automatically handles all the above aspects, offering a powerful
      multilingual solution to WordPress users, without any code or technical
      development. Let’s see how it works in a detailed tutorial. How to
