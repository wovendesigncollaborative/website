    <ng-container description>As cities get denser, and the value of space soars, innovative solutions are required to
      give the city back to its people. Our design team understands the complexities of urbanism, and design city and
      neighbourhood scale spaces accordingly. We design safe and interactive public space design with a focus on

    <ng-container description>Breaking away from a compartmentalised outlook, we approach development contextually, to
      bring sustainable livelihood opportunity to rural areas, while preserving the environment and building a cohesive
      and empowered community. Redefining the meaning of “development” WDC shifts the focus towards increased quality of
      life and empowerment so as to dissuade unsustainable migration and increasing community ownership. With a
      future-centric, integrated and multi-disciplinary approach, we enable communities to direct their own growth.

      different types of eco-systems and the complexity of their inter-relationship and developing a toolkit for
      implementation. The plan shall identify lands for different types of plantations and ecosystems in line with the
      natural system that the region hosts. The toolkit shall enable local community and implementation partners to
      choose appropriate species and planting, irrigation and maintenance techniques for maximum benefit- both
      ecologically and agriculturally.
